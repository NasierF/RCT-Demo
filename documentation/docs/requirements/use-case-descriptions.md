7. Ian attempts to fix problem by using old timing values to replace the new ones. 
8. Ian test drives the vehicle. 
9. The issue is still persistent which suggests that it may be a mechanical issue. 
10. Ian notices that the timing belt is frayed and coming off. He reverts the data as that was not the issue.
